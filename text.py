    Under certain circumstances, repeated administration of stimulants and opiates results in increasingly
    larger motor-activating effects, and these effects have
    been hypothesized to contribute to the development
    of the neuroadaptations associated with addiction,
    particularly those involving initial use and/or reinstatement of drug-taking following abstinence. This
    sensitization to the activating effects of stimulants
    involves activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system
    (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). Repeated microinjections of amphetamine into the somatodendritic region
    of the ventral tegmental dopamine cells, at doses that
    do not cause behavioral activation, are suffi cient to
    sensitize the dopamine cells to later systemic injections of amphetamine. Thus, changes in the activity
    of these dopamine cells are sufficient to produce
    sensitization.
    Multiple mechanisms for sensitization have been
    proposed, and a common theme is a time-dependent
    chain of adaptations that ultimately leads to longlasting changes in the function of the mesolimbic
    dopamine system (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). For
    example, repeated administration of cocaine produces
    a decrease in the sensitivity of impulse-regulating
    somatodendritic dopamine D2 receptors on dopamine
    neurons (termed autoreceptors because the neuron is
    itself responding to the transmitter it releases). Because
    these autoreceptors normally exert an inhibitory infl uence on the activity of dopaminergic neurons, this
    change in sensitivity could translate into enhanced
    dopamine availability with subsequent injections of
    cocaine (Robinson and Berridge, 1993). However, the
    decrease in D2 receptor sensitivity lasts only four to
    eight days, and behavioral sensitization can last for
    weeks; thus, other mechanisms also must be involved.
    N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor
    antagonists selectively block the development of sensitization to psychomotor stimulants, suggesting a role
    for brain glutamate systems and specific glutamate
    receptors in sensitization (Koob and Le Moal, 2001)."""

Improving Health and Education Baby boom children benefitted from a host of important advances in
public health and medical practice in the postwar
years. Formerly serious illnesses became merely routine after the introduction of such “miracle drugs”
as penicillin (introduced in 1943), streptomycin
(1945), and cortisone (1946). When Dr. Jonas Salk
perfected a polio vaccine in 1954, he became a
national hero. The free distribution of Salk’s vaccine
in the nation’s schools, followed in 1961 by Dr. Albert
Sabin’s oral polio vaccine, demonstrated the potential
of government-sponsored public health programs.
The baby boom also gave the nation’s educational
system a boost. Postwar middle-class parents, America’s
first college-educated generation, placed a high value
on education. Suburban parents approved 90 percent
of school bond issues during the 1950s. By 1970, school expenditures accounted for 7.2 percent of the gross
national product, double the 1950 level. In the 1960s,
the baby boom generation swelled college enrollments.
State university systems grew in tandem: the pioneering University of California, University of Wisconsin,
and State University of New York systems added dozens of new campuses and offered students in their
states a low-cost college education.
Dr. Benjamin Spock To keep baby boom children
healthy and happy, middle-class parents increasingly
relied on the advice of experts. Dr. Benjamin Spock’s
Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care sold 1 million copies every year after its publication in 1946.
Spock urged mothers to abandon the rigid feeding
and baby-care schedules of an earlier generation. New
mothers found Spock’s commonsense approach liberating. “Your little paperback is still in my cupboard,
with loose pages, rather worn from use because I
brought up two babies using it as my ‘Bible,’ ” a California housewife wrote to Spock.
Despite his commonsense approach to child rearing, Spock was part of a generation of psychological
experts whose advice often failed to reassure women. If
mothers were too protective, Spock and others argued,
they might hamper their children’s preparation for
adult life. On the other hand, mothers who wanted to
work outside the home felt guilty because Spock recommended that they be constantly available for their
children. As American mothers
aimed for the perfection demanded
of them seemingly at every turn,
many began to question these
mixed messages. Some of them
would be inspired by the resurgence of feminism in the 1960s
